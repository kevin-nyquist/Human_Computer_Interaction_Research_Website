      <p>
        Large, lecture-style university courses are not conducive to active learning because students have varying learning styles requiring individual attention from teachers. This lack of access to teachers in a timely manner, and ineffective communication to inquiry about questions regarding content makes students feel marginalized. Professors attempt to remedy this situation by resorting to instructional technology. However, the users of the platform, students in large university style lectures are assumed to be “average users” with uniform characteristics. This bias, rather than promoting active learning for students and providing timely feedback to students, makes instructional technology platforms, such as Rampant Strategy, fail to meet the needs of both students and instructors.
