    <p align="center"><b>Team:&nbsp;</b>O.M.N.I. KREW</p>

    <p align="center"><b>Milestone 4</b></p>
    <p>
      Rampant Strategy is a platform being used by students in large
      undergraduate classrooms at the University of Georgia. It was deployed
      in classrooms to allow teachers to make feedback and grades accessible
      to students in a timely manner. Rampant Strategy was supposed to allow
      teachers and teaching assistants to communicate with students
      effectively regarding assignments, &nbsp;to allow teachers and teaching
      assistants to give instructions to students regarding coursework and
      allow students to access the platform functionalities to easily submit
      homework online.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user experience of Rampant Strategy is far from ideal. Students are
      hindered from completing coursework because of bad design. Cluttered and
      confusing mapping causes students to have issues navigating pages,
      saving work, and accessing feedback from the instructor. Grades are
      affected because of difficulty submitting polls and assignments. There
      are no signifiers on the buttons to indicate interactability. This lack
      of signifiers causes students to miss vital information about
      assignments. Poor design has caused issues of accessibility and
      effectiveness. Rather than promoting active learning for students, and
      providing timely feedback to students, Rampant Strategy falls short of
      meeting the needs of students, teaching assistants and
      instructors.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the aim of this protocol is to conduct a usability test during
      the re-design and development of Rampant Strategy to improve user
      experience. According to Usability.gov, &ldquo;the goals of usability
      testing include establishing a baseline of user performance,
      establishing and validating user performance measures, and identifying
      design concerns to be addressed in order to improve user experience as
      measured by accessibility and effectiveness.&rdquo; Using a systems
      approach to design, we define accessibility as the process which
      &nbsp;ensures that users have information, activities and/or
      environments available to complete tasks comfortably and without major
      complications. Or the practice of making these aspects of a system
      sensible, meaningful, and usable for as many people as possible.
      Effective communication is the interchange between two or more persons
      for the purpose of delivering, receiving, and understanding a message
      successfully in a timely manner.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      <b>A. Objective:&nbsp;</b>The usability test objectives for this project are as
      follows:&nbsp;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          To determine design inconsistencies and usability problem areas
          within the user interface specifically for accessibility and
          effectiveness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Establish a CONTROL GROUP for baseline user performance and
          user-satisfaction levels of the user interface with a control group.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Test the prototype with EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (undergraduate students)
          at UGA.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>B. Research Question:&nbsp;</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>How accessible are affordances and signifiers to users?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How effective are the functionalities of Rampant Strategy?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do the affordances and signifiers allow for effective communication
          between students and teachers?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What are the user assumptions made by designers?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>C. Hypothesis:&nbsp;</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          By recognizing and responding to bias, the prototype makes Rampant
          Strategy effective and accessible which results in improvement of
          user experience.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The modifications in design incorporating affordances and signifiers
          to address user needs for accessibility and effective use of the
          platform results in improvement of user experience.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Null Hypothesis:</b></p>
    <p>
      Modifications in design incorporating affordances and signifiers to
      address user needs for accessibility and effective use of the platform
      do not result in improvement of user experience.
    </p>
    <p><b>D. METHODOLOGY</b></p>
    <p>
      Good designers &ldquo;start by trying to understand what the real issues
      are.&rdquo; (Norman, 2013. p. 218). Therefore, rather than using
      traditional measures of people, such as age, education, and income, the
      study will be based on an activity centered approach of first gaining a
      deep understanding of students&rsquo; needs around activities to be
      performed. In order to obtain IRB approval the following documents will
      be submitted - Letter of informed consent, Letter to students seeking
      participation, Instruments for data collection - survey, interview.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Letter of Informed Consent</b>&nbsp;&ndash; This is an important step in
          any research protocol. The Belmont Report was written by the
          National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of
          Biomedical and Behavioral Research. Please see attached.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Letter to Students seeking participation</b>&nbsp;- This letter will be
          sent to all the students in the Management Information Systems class
          seeking their participation in the study.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Instruments for data collection</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Please see attached for
          specific data that will be collected. There are advantages and
          disadvantages with every instrument. Two instruments were chosen in
          order to confirm the results for validity and reliability.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A&nbsp;<b>survey</b>&nbsp;is useful to gather data on demographics of users,
      how widespread are the needs, and other instructional and environmental
      factors. This study is activity centered and thus no demographic
      information will be collected. In addition, students will be informed
      that it is Rampant Strategy that is being tested.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Interviews</b>&nbsp;are important sources of understanding contextual
      factors such as perception of task relevance, opportunities to perform;
      and cultural factors such as whether hierarchy has any influence on
      performance. They provide an opportunity to ask open-ended questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Experimental Group is the user group which includes students
          enrolled in large undergraduate classes in which teachers are using
          Rampant Strategy. Although the number of students who will
          participate in the test cannot be estimated at this time, typically
          the classes have over 150 students.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Participants will be informed that it is not they who are being
          studied, but rather the application Rampant Strategy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Control Group are students who will respond to the same survey
          but they will only have access to the older version of Rampant
          Strategy. This will establish a baseline user performance and
          user-satisfaction levels of the user interface with a control group.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>E. ANALYSIS</b></p>
    <p>
      Data will be used to assess whether usability goals regarding
      accessibility and effectiveness have been achieved. Difference in
      responses to the survey questions will be analyzed with statistical
      software such as ANOVA, linear regression or t-test. If the change is
      statistically significant then it will corroborate our hypothesis that
      the modifications in design to incorporate affordances and signifiers
      address user needs for accessibility and effective use of the platform
      results in improvement of user experience.
    </p>
    <p><b>F. BENEFITS</b></p>
    <p>
      To improve this educational technology tool, we propose a more intuitive
      interface that would benefit all parties involved. The proposed changes
      to Rampant Strategy, such as replacing the button on the side nav-bar
      with a drop-down on the top nav-bar and splitting the current submit
      button into Save and Submit buttons, would help to address the confusion
      and improve the usability of the platform. These changes could
      significantly enhance the learning experience for students and improve
      the efficiency of instructors and teaching assistants in conducting
      classes and grading assignments.
