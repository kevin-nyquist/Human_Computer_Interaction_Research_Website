        Current Alternatives
      </h3>
      <p>
        One alternative to Rampant Strategy is Tophat, a website that allows students to participate in multiple different types of polls and interactions, view class slides and resources, take quizzes and exams, and submit homework assignments. Tophat covers many of the same functionalities as Rampant Strategy and more while also having much clearer navigation. Tophat allows for users to easily save their information mid-assignment, swap between class resources, polls, and grades, and even do all of this from mobile devices. However, Tophat is far less affordable than Rampant Strategy.

      <h3>
        Guidelines and Principles for a Potential Solution
      </h3>
      <p>
        Potential guidelines and solutions which can help shape possible solutions for Rampant Strategy are Section 508 and ISTE. Guidelines are low-level focused advice about good practices and cautions against dangers. Section 508 would be a potential guideline since it will provide a basis for ensuring that students with disabilities and, in general, all students have access to the affordances. Principles are middle-level strategies or rules to analyze and compare design alternatives. International Society for Technology Educators (ISTE) standards would be an example of principles that would be useful for improving communication and accessibility.
