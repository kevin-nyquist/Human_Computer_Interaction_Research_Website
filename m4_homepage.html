      <h3>
        Our Problem
      </h3>
      <p>
        Large, lecture-style university courses are not conducive to active learning because students have varying learning styles requiring individual attention from teachers. This lack of access to teachers in a timely manner, and ineffective communication to inquiry about questions regarding content makes students feel marginalized. Professors attempt to remedy this situation by resorting to instructional technology. However, the users of the platform, students in large university style lectures are assumed to be “average users” with uniform characteristics. This bias, rather than promoting active learning for students and providing timely feedback to students, makes instructional technology platforms, such as Rampant Strategy, fail to meet the needs of both students and instructors.

        What we found Easy / Hard
      </h3>
      <p>
        Using the mockups from the previous milestone, it was very easy to get started with the prototyping. Making different pages and implementing functionality was difficult at first, but once we got the hang of it the rest of the work simple to add. The biggest struggle was being able to get together for planning and recording while everyone prepared for other finals.      </p>
