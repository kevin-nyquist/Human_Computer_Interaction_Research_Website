      <p>
        Attached above is the Figma file used by our team to create the preliminary wireframes for Milestone 3. These wireframes 
        were made with the keypoints of our ideation phase in mind. We used two of the highlighted features that were premeditated 
        during our ideation phase and created two different wireframes for our user stories based upon them. We tried to find 
        acceptable justification for wireframes and drafted them under the figma wireframes, before finalizing our design considerations
        for our mockups.
